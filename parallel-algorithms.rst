Parallel Algorithms
===================

In this chapter, we will present a number of parallel algorithms for
solving a number of problems. We will make effective use of the SOAC
parallel array combinators. In particular, it turns out that the
operator is critical for writing parallel algorithms. In fact, we shall
first develop the notion of a *segmented scan* operation, which, as we
shall see, can be implemented using Futharkâ€™s operator, and which in its
own right is essential to many of the later algorithms.

Based on the segmented scan operator and the other Futhark SOAC
operations, but before investigating more challenges algorithms, we also
present a set of utility functions as well as their parallel
implementations.

.. sec:sgmscan:

Segmented Scan
--------------

The segmented scan operator is quite essential as we shall see
demonstrated in many of the algorithms explained later. The operator
can be implemented with a simple scan using an associative function
that operates on pairs of values
:cite:`Schwartz:1980:ULT:357114.357116,blelloch1990vector`.  Here is
the definition of the segmented scan operation, hardcoded to work with
addition:

.. literalinclude:: src/sgm_scan.fut
   :lines: 4-11

We can make use of Futhark's support for higher-order functions and
polymorphism to define a generic version of segmented scan that will
work for other monoidal structures than addition on ``i32`` values:

.. literalinclude:: src/sgm_scan.fut
   :lines: 13-20

We leave it up to the reader to prove that, given an associative
function ``g``, (1) the operator passed to ``scan`` is associative
and (2) ``(ne, false)`` is a neutral element for the operator.


Parallel Utility Functions
--------------------------

For use by other algorithms, a set of utility functions for manipulating
and managing arrays is an important part of the tool box. We present a
number of utility functions here, ranging from finding elements in an
array to finding the maximum element and its index in an array.

Finding the Index of an Element in an Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We device two different functions for finding an index in an array for
which the content is identical to some given value. The first
function, ``find_idx_first``, takes a value ``e`` and an array ``xs``
and returns the smallest index ``i`` into ``xs`` for which ``xs[i] =
e``:

.. literalinclude:: src/find_idx.fut
   :lines: 4-8

The second function, ``find_idx_last``, also takes a value and an
array but returns the largest index ``i`` into ``xs`` for which
``xs[i] = e``:

.. literalinclude:: src/find_idx.fut
   :lines: 10-13

The above two functions make use of the auxiliary functions
``i32.max`` and ``i32.min``.

Finding the Largest Element and its Index in an Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Futhark allows for reduction operators to take tuples as arguments. This
feature is exploited in the following function, which implements a
homomorphism for finding the largest element and its index in an array:

.. literalinclude:: src/maxidx.fut
   :lines: 4-11

The function is a *homomorphism* :cite:`BirdListTh`: For any :math:`x`
and :math:`y`, and with :math:`++` denoting array concatenation, there
exists an associative operator :math:`\oplus` such that

.. math::
   \kw{maxidx}(x \pp y) = \kw{maxidx}(x) \oplus \kw{maxidx}(y)

The operator :math:`\oplus = \kw{mx}`. We will leave it up to the
reader to verify that the ``maxidx`` function will operate efficiently
on large inputs.

Radix Sort
----------

A simple radix sort algorithm was presented already in
:ref:`radixsort`. In this section, we present two generalized versions
of radix sort, one for ascending sorting and one for descending
sorting. As a bonus, the sorting routines return both the sorted
array and an index array that can be used to sort an
array with respect to a permutation obtained by sorting another
array. The generalised ascending radix sort is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: src/rsort_idx.fut
   :lines: 14-31

And the descending version as follows:

.. literalinclude:: src/rsort_idx.fut
   :lines: 33-49

Notice that in case of identical elements in the source vector, one
cannot simply implement the ascending version by reversing the arrays
resulting from calling the descending version.

Finding the Longest Streak
--------------------------

In this section we shall demonstrate two different methods of finding
the longest streak of increasing numbers. One method makes use directly
of a segmented scan and the other method implicitly encodes the
segmented scan as an integrated part of the algorithm. We start by
showing the latter version of the longest streak problem:

.. literalinclude:: src/streak.fut
   :lines: 22-35

The following derivation shows how the algorithm works for a
particular input, namely when ``stream`` is given the argument array
``[1,5,3,4,2,6,7,8]``, in which case the algorithm should return the
value 3:

+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| Variable |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+==========+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
| ``xs``   | = | 1 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``ys``   | = | 5 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 1 |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``is``   | = | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``ss``   | = | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``ss``   | = | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``ss2``  | = | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``ss3``  | = | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``res``  | = | 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

A simpler algorithm builds directly on the segmented scan operation
defined earlier. The algorithm first constructs the ``is`` array as in
the previous algorithm and then uses a segmented scan over a negation
of this array over the unit-array to create the ``ss3`` vector
directly.

.. literalinclude:: src/sgm_streak.fut
   :lines: 31-38

Here is a derivation of how the segmented-scan based algorithm works:

+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| Variable |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+==========+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
| ``xs``   | = | 1 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``ys``   | = | 5 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 1 |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``is``   | = | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``fs``   | = | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``ss``   | = | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``res``  | = | 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

The morale here is that the segmented scan operation provides us with
a great abstraction.  However, for now, we have to get by with Futhark
not providing us with proper polymorphism.

Flattening by Expansion
-----------------------

For dealing with large non-regular problems, we need ways to
regularise the problems so that they become tractable with the regular
parallel techniques that we have seen demonstrated previously. One way
to regularise a problem is by *padding* data such that the data fits a
regular parallel schema. However, by doing so, we run the risk that
the program will use too many parallel resources for computations on
the padding data. This problem will arise, in particular, if the data
is very irregular. As a simple, and also visualisable, example,
consider the task of determining the points that make up a number of
line segments given by sets of two points in a 2D grid. Whereas we may
easily devise an algorithm for determining the grid points that make
up a single line segment, it is not immediately obvious how we can
efficiently regularise the problem of drawing multiple line segments,
as each line segment will end up being represented by a different
number of points. If we choose to implement a padding regularisation
scheme by introducing a notion of ''an empty point'', each line can be
represented as the same number of points, which will allow us to map
over an array of such line points for processing the lines using
regular parallelism. However, the cost we pay is that even the
smallest line will be represented as the same number of points as the
longest line.

Another strategy for regularisation is to *flatten* the irregular
parallelism into regular parallelism and use segmented operations to
process each particular object. It turns out that there, in many
cases, is a simple approach to implement such flattening, using, as we
shall see, a technique called *expansion*, which will take care of all
the knitty gritty details of the flattening. The expansion approach is
centered around a function that we shall call ``expand``, which, as
the name suggests, expands a source array into a longer target array,
by expanding each individual source element into multiple target
elements, which can then be processed in parallel.

For implementing the ``expand`` function, we first need to define a
few helper functions.

Replicated Iota and Segmented Iota
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first helper function that we need is called
``replicated_iota``. Given an array of natural numbers specifying
repetitions, the function returns an array of weakly increasing
indices (starting from 0) and with each index repeated according to
the repetition array. As an example, ``replicated_iota [2,3,1,1]``
returns the array ``[0,0,1,1,1,2,3]``. The function is defined in terms of
other parallel operations, including ``scan``, ``map``, ``scatter``,
and ``segmented_scan``:

.. literalinclude:: src/segmented.fut
   :lines: 44-49

An example evaluation of a call to the function ``replicated_iota`` is
provided below.  Notice that in order to use this Futhark code with
``futhark-opencl``, we need to prefix the array indexing in line 3 and
line 4 with the ``unsafe`` keyword.

+--------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| Args/Result        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+====================+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
| ``reps``           | = | 2 | 3 | 1 | 1 |   |   |   |
+--------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``s1``             | = | 2 | 5 | 6 | 7 |   |   |   |
+--------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``s2``             | = | 0 | 2 | 5 | 6 |   |   |   |
+--------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``replicate``      | = | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
+--------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``tmp``            | = | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 |
+--------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``flags``          | = | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
+--------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| ``segmented_scan`` | = | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
+--------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

The second helper function that we need is called
``segmented_iota``. Given a flags array, the function returns an array
of index sequences, each of which is reset according to the flags
array. As an example, the expression

::

    segmented_iota [false,false,false,true,false,false,false]

returns the array ``[0,1,2,0,1,2,3]``. This function
``segmented_iota`` can be implemented with the use of a simple call to
``segmented_scan`` followed by a call to ``map``:

.. literalinclude:: src/segmented.fut
   :lines: 57-59

Expansion
~~~~~~~~~

The generic expansion function that we set out to construct is now
somewhat simple to implement using only parallel operations. Here is
the generic type of the function:

::

    val expand 'a 'b : (sz: a -> i32) -> (get: a -> i32 -> b) -> []a -> []b

The function expands a source array into a target array given (1) a
function that determines, for each source element, how many target
elements it expands to and (2) a function that computes a particular
target element based on a source element and the target element number
associated with the source. As an example, the expression ``expand
(\x->x) (*) [2,3,1]`` returns the array ``[0,2,0,3,6,0]``. The
function is defined as follows:

.. literalinclude:: src/segmented.fut
   :lines: 69-73


Segmented Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MEMO: revise:

The first helper function that we need is a function for replicating
elements in a one-dimensional data array according to natural numbers
appearing in a *replication* array of the same length. We shall call
such an operation a *segmented replicate* and we shall provide the
replication array as the first argument and the data vector as the
second argument. If we call the operation ``segmented_replicate``, a
call ``segmented_replicate [2,1,0,3,0] [5,6,9,8,4]`` should result in
the array ``[5,5,6,8,8,8]``.

Here is code that implements the function ``segmented_replicate`` and a more
general function ``replicated_iota``, which returns an index array providing
replicating indexes into any argument array of the same length as the
argument array.

.. literalinclude:: src/sgm_repl.fut
   :lines: 13-22


Line Drawing
------------

In this section we demonstrate how to apply the
flattening-by-expansion technique for obtaining a work efficient line
drawing routine that draws lines fully in parallel. The technique
resembles the development by Blelloch :cite:`blelloch1990vector` with
the difference that it makes use of the ``expand`` function defined in
the previous section. Given a number of line segments, each defined by its
end points :math:`(x_1,y_1)` and :math:`(x_2,y_2)`, the algorithm will
find the set of all points constituting all the line segments.

We first present an algorithm that will find all points that
constitutes a single line segment. For computing this set, observe
that the number of points that make up the constituting set is the
maximum of :math:`|x_2-x_1|` and :math:`|y_2-y_1|`, the absolute
values of the difference in :math:`x`-coordinates and
:math:`y`-coordinates, respectively. Using this observation, the
algorithm can idependently compute the constituting set by first
calculating the proper direction and slope of a line, relative to a
particular starting point.

The simple line drawing routine is given as follows:

.. literalinclude:: src/lines_seq.fut
   :lines: 6-25

Futhark code that uses the ``linepoints`` function for drawing
concrete lines is shown below:

.. literalinclude:: src/lines_seq.fut
   :lines: 27-47

The function ``main`` sets up a grid and calls
the function ``drawlines``, which takes care of sequentially updating
the grid with constituting points for each line, computed using the
``linepoints`` function. The resulting points look like this:

.. image:: img/lines_grid.svg

An unfortunate problem with the line drawing routine shown above is
that it draws the lines sequentially, one by one, and therefore makes
only very limited use of a GPU's parallel cores. There are various
ways one may mitigate this problem. One way could be to use ``map`` to
draw lines in parallel. However, such an approach will require some
kind of padding to ensure that the map function will compute data of
the same length, no matter the length of the line. A more resource
aware approach will apply a flattening technique for computing all
points defined by all lines simultaneously. Using the ``expand``
function defined in the previous section, all we need to do to
implement this approach is to provide (1) a function that determines
for a given line, the number of points that make up the line and (2) a
function that determines the ``n``'th point of a particular line, given
the index ``n``. The code for such an approach looks as follows:

.. literalinclude:: src/lines_flat2.fut
   :lines: 29-50

The function ``get_point_in_line`` distinguishes between whether the
number of points in the line is counted by the x-axis or the y-axis.



Low-Discrepancy Sequences
-------------------------

Futhark comes with a library for generating Sobol sequences, which are
examples of so-called low-discrepancy sequences, sequences that, when
combined with Monte-Carlo methods, make numeric integration converge
faster than if ordinary pseudo-random numbers are used. Sobol
sequences may be multi-dimensional and a calculation of a sequence
depends on a set of direction-vectors, which are also provided by the
Futhark Sobol library.

As an example, we shall see how we can use Sobol sequences together
with Monte-Carlo simulation to compute the value of :math:`\pi`. We shall
also see that doing so will result in faster conversion towards the
true value of :math:`\pi` compared to if a simpler stratified sampling
approach is used.

To calculate an approximation to the value of :math:`\pi`, we will use
a simple dart-throwing approach. We will throw darts randomly at a 2
by 2 square, centered around the origin, and then establish the ratio between the number of darts
hitting within the unit circle with the number of darts hitting the
square. This ration multiplied with 4 will be our approximation of
:math:`\pi`. The more darts we throw, the better our approximation. To
calculate whether a particular dart, thrown at the point
:math:`(x,y)`, is within the unit circle, we can apply the standard
Pythagoras formula:

.. math::
   \pi ~~\approx~~ \frac{4}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left \{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & \mbox{if} ~ x_i^2 + y_i^2 < 1 \\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array} \right .

For the actual throwing of darts, we need to establish :math:`N` pairs of numbers, each
in the interval [-1;1]. We will need a two-dimensional Sobol sequence.

The Futhark library, as we shall see, makes essential use of the
formula for calculating the :math:`n`'th Sobol number. However, even
though such a formula is essential for achieving parallelism, it
performs poorly compared to the efficient recurrent formula, which
makes it possible to calculate the :math:`n`'th Sobol number if we
know the previous Sobol number.  The Futhark library makes essential
use of both formulas.
