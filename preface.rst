Preface
=======

This book is written with the aim of providing an introduction to
parallel functional programming and algorithms with the focus on using
the Futhark language as the development language.

Futhark is currently being actively developed but it is mature enough
that simple algorithms—and also quite a few non-trivial ones—can be
written in the language and executed in parallel on real parallel GPU
hardware.

kinds of typos and errors in the text and in the enclosed programs. The
book’s main repository is https://github.com/HIPERFIT/futhark-book.

Regarding errors in the programs, most of the programs written in the
book can be run and tested against an expected result; this execution
and test can be done by typing ``make`` in the ``src/`` directory of the
repository.
